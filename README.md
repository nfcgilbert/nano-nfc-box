# nano-nfc-box
Demo code for the protocol of the Nano Blackbox

# The Nano Blackbox...
... is an NFC cashpoint that utilises the cryptocurrency Nano. It is currently in the last phase of its development. It's not yet fully ready.

# This repo...
... contains an example Android app to communicate with the Nano Blackbox. I guess without the box itself it will be impossible to test for you at the moment.

# What's required to run this?
A smartphone that can do NFC and runs an Android version that supports it.  

# More information?
You may find more information on https://nanoblackbox.net

Yours faithfully,
